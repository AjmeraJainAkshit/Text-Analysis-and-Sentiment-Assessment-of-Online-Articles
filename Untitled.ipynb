    "### The below provided code snippet demonstrates a straightforward approach to read and process words from specified text files (positive-words.txt and negative-words.txt). It uses a function read_words_from_file to read each file, strip whitespace, and convert the resulting list into a set of unique words. Finally, it prints the loaded positive and negative words sets. This functionality is commonly used in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, where positive and negative word lists are essential for determining sentiment in text data."
